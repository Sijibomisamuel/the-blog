                            <p>Experienced duo Simon Francis and Andrew Surman have left relegated Bournemouth after
                                being told they would not be offered new contracts.

                                Club captain Francis spent eight-and-a-half years on the south coast and his deputy
                                Surman seven, both playing key roles in the club’s rise to the Premier League and
                                five-season stay among the big boys.

                                A statement released on the club’s official website said: “AFC Bournemouth can confirm
                                that club captain Simon Francis and vice-captain Andrew Surman will not be offered new
                                contracts and have left the club.

                                “The long-serving pair, whose contracts expired at the end of July, have been an
                                integral part of the club’s rise up the football pyramid, culminating in a five-year
                                stay in the Premier League.

                                “However, following the Cherries’ relegation last month, it has been agreed that both
                                players will be free to find new clubs, and the club wholeheartedly thanks them for
                                their incredible commitment over the past decade.”

                                Bournemouth have confirmed that full-back Charlie Daniels, who is also out of contract,
                                will train with the club in pre-season as he continues to work his way back from a
                                dislocated knee.</p>

                                    </h2>

                                    <h3>Jack Grealish: Decision time looming</h3>
                                    <img src="./img/blog/grealish.jpg" alt="">
                                    <p>Jack Grealish has admitted he is "not too sure" about his Aston Villa future -
                                        and
                                        that is little surprise with the hype surrounding him. Only Kevin De Bruyne made
                                        more chances across the entire Premier League season, and the Villa captain made
                                        almost a quarter of the club's scoring opportunities on his own. That sort of
                                        creativity is difficult to teach, which is something clearly not lost on
                                        long-term suitors Manchester United, who for a long time have appeared to be
                                        leading the chase for his signature.

                                        Although he has spent the season largely cutting in from the Villa left flank,
                                        there looks to be a Grealish-shaped hole on the right of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's
                                        front three - after a bright start, summer recruit Dan James' form has faded,
                                        while Mason Greenwood's future could be more central.

                                        However, United's interest has cooled on the back of Villa's survival, which has
                                        placed a price tag upwards of £80m on Grealish's head. United chief Ed Woodward
                                        has admitted the club has not been exempt from the effects of the coronavirus
                                        pandemic, and the 24-year-old's signature would make a significant dent in their
                                        transfer kitty.</p>

                                    <h3>Mesut Ozil: What's the exit plan?</h3>
                                    <img src="https://e1.365dm.com/20/06/660x350/skysports-mesut-ozil-arsenal_5008604.jpg"

                                    <p>How do you solve a problem like Mesut Ozil? It is a long running saga that never
                                        seems to end, with Arsenal's highest earner appearing happy to see out his
                                        £350,000-a-week contract in north London.

                                        Gunners head coach Mikel Arteta has appeared to draw a line under the saga.
                                        Ozil, who has a year left on his Arsenal contract, does not look to be part of
                                        the Spaniard's plans. The stark fact of the matter is that Ozil didn't play a
                                        minute of football after the Premier League restarted and wasn't even on the
                                        bench for their final two matches.

                                        It is no secret Arsenal would love to get Ozil's mammoth wages off their wage
                                        book but will Arteta's strong management be enough to convince the German it is
                                        time to leave the Emirates Stadium? Are there even any clubs interested in
                                        signing him and paying his mammoth wages after the financial strain of the
                                        coronavirus pandemic? Will Arsenal even pay some of his wages to finally get the
                                        World Cup winner away from the club?

                                        These are the questions the Gunners will finally hope to have answers to as they
                                        look to solve their Ozil conundrum.</p>

                                    <h3>Wilfried Zaha: Time up at Palace?</h3>
                                    <img src="https://e0.365dm.com/20/07/660x350/skysports-wilfried-zaha-crystal-palace_5037485.jpg"
                                        alt="">

                                    <p>It was no secret that Wilfried Zaha wanted to leave Crystal Palace last summer,
                                        but the move didn't happen and despite his initial disappointment he managed to
                                        get his head right and focus on doing his best for Palace. But a year on, and
                                        Zaha finds himself in the same situation.

                                        Palace haven't matched his on-field ambitions, he's changed agents and he
                                        recently said he wanted to win trophies. Palace held firm on their £80m
                                        valuation last summer but that sort of asking price will be unlikely with the
                                        current Covid-19 pandemic expected to affect spending. Arsenal were interested
                                        last season - as were Everton.

                                        Crystal Palace signed off with a 1-1 draw against Tottenham but manager Roy
                                        Hodgson admits he faces another battle to keep hold of Zaha.

                                        "It's a dilemma for the club and for him if he is so set on leaving," he said.

                                        "We still like him very much, we can't make him like us. It's obviously affected
                                        him because his form in the last few weeks has been quite poor considering what
                                        he is capable of doing. I don't have an answer."</p>

                                    <p>There is considerable hype surrounding Germany's hottest prospects, Timo Werner
                                        and Kai Havertz. Chelsea have already snapped up the former from RB Leipzig and
                                        they are eager to prise the latter away from Bayer Leverkusen as well.

                                        But at just 21 years old, Havertz will cost a premium price - reportedly in the
                                        region of £70-90m. Why so much? The versatile forward set a Bundesliga record
                                        for most goals by a teenager with 17 last season and became the youngest player
                                        to reach 100 league appearance in the German top-flight this season.</p>

                                    <p>What will Frank Lampard be getting? According to Statsbomb, Havertz is strikingly
                                        similar to fellow youngster Christian Pulisic - who began to look capable of
                                        filling Eden Hazard's boots as the season progressed this season. Chelsea appear
                                        to be in the hunt for even more youthful flair - as if they needed any more.</p>

                                    <h3>Gareth Bale: Will he settle for fringe role at Real?</h3>
                                    <img src="https://e0.365dm.com/20/07/660x350/skysports-gareth-bale-real-madrid_5040419.jpg"
                                        alt="">

                                    <p>Gareth Bale's spell at Real Madrid has descended into a soap opera. During their
                                        recent charge towards La Liga glory, he was most commonly seen joking around in
                                        the stands, an unused substitute with little prospect of winning back his place
                                        in the team. When the squad threw Zinedine Zidane into the air in celebration
                                        after the 2-1 win over Villarreal that sealed the title, Bale watched quietly
                                        from the fringes.

                                        His relationship with Zidane has been fractured since the 2018 Champions League
                                        final win over Liverpool, when he was left out of the starting line-up only to
                                        come off the bench and score the decisive goals, and recent evidence suggests it
                                        is now broken beyond repair. Bale has only started five games since the turn of
                                        the year and one since the restart.

                                        The problem for Real Madrid, of course, is that Bale has a contract - and an
                                        extraordinarily lucrative one at that - until 2022. The Welshman was close to
                                        sealing a move to China last summer, but the deal fell through and his agent,
                                        Jonathan Barnett, now insists he has no plans to leave. It remains to be seen
                                        whether any Premier League sides could try to change his mind.</p>

                                        But this window could mark the beginning of a lot of speculation over his future
                                        after a tumultuous campaign at the Nou Camp.

                                        Messi is unsettled and frustrated at Barca and - for the first time - is
                                        seriously thinking of leaving next year, having broken off from new contract
                                        talks. He is fed up of conflict with the board, and of widespread rumours that
                                        he is the one that calls the shots at the club.

                                        Inevitable links will be made with Manchester City for as long as Pep Guardiola,
                                        whom he considers to be the best coach he has worked with, is still the manager,
                                        while Inter Milan boss Antonio Conte has labelled their link with Messi as "fake
                                        news". Regardless, there is a lot of time still to pass before his contract
                                        expires, so a lot of time to either work things out or widen the rift even
                                        further.</p>

                                    <h3>Harry Kane: Sticking with Spurs?</h3>
                                    <img src="https://e0.365dm.com/20/04/660x350/skysports-kane-premier-league_4971058.jpg"

                                    <p>Remember the stir created during lockdown when Harry Kane told Sky Sports he
                                        would be prepared to leave Tottenham if he felt the club wasn't progressing?

                                        "I love Spurs, I'll always love Spurs. But it's one of those things - I've
                                        always said if I don't feel we're progressing as a team or going in the right
                                        direction, then I'm not someone to just stay there for the sake of it," said
                                        Kane. "It all depends on what happens as a team and how we progress as a team.
                                        So it's not a definite I'm going to stay there forever - but it's not a no
                                        either."

                                        His talent up front needs no debate. He is an outstanding striker and would
                                        certainly bring goals to any team he plays for with Golden Boots from the
                                        Premier League (twice) and World Cup as proof. Any forward who performs well
                                        will be loved by the fans, but there would be the same relationship between
                                        player and another club that Kane currently has with Tottenham?

                                        This will likely be on his list of considerations but so will trophies and a
                                        player of his calibre deserves to be lifting them. Mourinho is often described
                                        as a serial winner but with Tottenham being that 'almost, but not quite' club,
                                        can he instil a winning mentality that will convince Kane to stay with his
                                        boyhood side? And would he have a better chance of winning silverware with the
                                        likes of Manchester United? Or should he be aiming right for the top where
                                        trophies are a requirement - not an aim - such as Real Madrid, who have been
                                        linked with Kane in the past.

                                        This season has been the antithesis of progress for Tottenham with a dramatic
                                        change of manager and a first finish outside the top four since the 2014/15
                                        season. Kane has once again had his injury problems and may want to wait a
                                        little longer to see if Mourinho can inspire an improvement at Spurs. But there
                                        would certainly be plenty of suitors willing to meet his demands...</p>

                                    <p>Declan Rice's future at West Ham depended a great deal on what division the club
                                        would find themselves playing in next season. With the Hammers' Premier League
                                        status now assured they have at least guaranteed Rice will not be leaving on the
                                        cheap. That is if he even moves at all.

                                        Despite interest from Chelsea - the club that released Rice at the age of 14 -
                                        West Ham have been clear they have no desire to sell the England international.
                                        "He's under contract...he's not going anywhere unless you get one of those steel
                                        vans that have the cash in it," Hammers boss David Moyes said after the final
                                        day of the Premier League season.

                                        Moyes is keen to build his team around young players such as Rice and, with the
                                        likes of Ben Johnson and Grady Diangana also at the club, the Scot's plan for a
                                        new, youthful and vibrant West Ham could begin to take shape quite quickly.

                                        If Chelsea do decide to follow up their interest this summer, there is no doubt
                                        they will need deep pockets - West Ham value Rice at around £80m. In previous
                                        years, West Ham have experienced the likes of Dimitri Payet and Marko Arnautovic
                                        trying to force through moves away from the club. They were successful in doing
                                        so. However, Rice is unlikely to deploy such tactics.

                                        History tells us that there will come a time when West Ham will eventually part
                                        ways with their very best talent - but, for now at least, they can demand the
                                        utmost amount for their star man.</p>

                                    <p>Could Chelsea's summer spending spree continue with a move for Leicester's Ben
                                        Chilwell? Frank Lampard is known to be a keen admirer of the left-back, who has
                                        impressed for the Foxes for the last three seasons and become a regular starter
                                        for England in the process.

                                        Chelsea are unlikely to be the only side who register an interest, however, with
                                        Sky Sports News reporting that Manchester City are also eager to secure his
                                        services. Pep Guardiola even went out of his way to compliment the 23-year-old
                                        at the Etihad Stadium on the pitch following City's win over Leicester last
                                        season. "He just said he thought I was a really talented player," revealed
                                        Chilwell afterwards.

                                        Leicester, however, are unlikely to allow him to leave cheaply. Chilwell was
                                        ruled out of the season finale due to a foot injury, but manager Brendan Rodgers
                                        insists he has not played his last game for the club and says he is confident of
                                        keeping him. "There's no intention to sell Ben Chilwell and absolutely no need
                                        to sell," he said recently. "The message is: He's not for sale."</p>

                                    <p>Paul Pogba's timely return to form and the Manchester United first team coincided
                                        with the club's post-lockdown resurgence that secured Champions League
                                        qualification on the final day of the Premier League season.

                                        But for those thinking Pogba's revival finally puts an end to speculation
                                        surrounding the Frenchman's future, well, things are not as simple as that.

                                        For all the talk that Pogba's recent form will be rewarded with a lengthy new
                                        contract at Old Trafford, speculation over potential moves to Real Madrid or
                                        Juventus will rumble until his future is secured.

                                        It is a situation agent Mino Raiola will look to take advantage of as he seeks
                                        the best deal for his client, and whether Pogba signs an extension or leaves
                                        United, you can almost guarantee he will be at the centre of a transfer saga
                                        that could define this window.</p>

                                    <p>After a quiet first campaign at Wolves in which he made only eight league starts,
                                        Adama Traore enjoyed a stunning second season, not only wowing Wolves fans but
                                        emerging as the neutrals' favourite. He is the Premier League's most explosive
                                        player.

                                        Traore saved some of his best work for the biggest occasions - scoring at home
                                        and away in wins over Manchester City - but he has been a consistent performer
                                        too. As well as topping the dribbling charts, his nine Premier League assists
                                        ended all talk of a lack of end product.

                                        Who should be interested? Just about every team in the world. Jurgen Klopp at
                                        Liverpool is an admirer. Part of the attraction is that coaches need not have a
                                        ready-made role for him in their line-up - he is a one-man plan B. An option
                                        from the bench capable of changing any game.

                                        If there is a problem it could be the price. At 24, and under contract until
                                        2023, Wolves are well aware of his value. One fee floated is as high as £135m.
                                        It might not take anywhere near that much to prise him away from Molineux, but
                                        expect big numbers involved.</p>

                                        Of the current Premier League defenders aged 25 or under, only Hector Bellerin
                                        and Luke Shaw have racked up more top-flight appearances. Ake's positional
                                        development - from defensive midfielder, to left-back, to centre-back - also
                                        provides a versatility which would appeal to the likes of Pep Guardiola.

                                        Since his permanent switch in 2017, the Cherries' win percentage jumps 17 per
                                        cent with him in the team and they concede fewer goals. That blend of youth,

                                        will inevitably be a thought that the Cherries are ripe for picking following

                                        an underwhelming campaign in Bavaria that has often seen Coutinho left out of
                                        the club's key fixtures.

                                        With the 28-year-old having spent five hugely successful years with Liverpool,
                                        though, do not be surprised to see him back in the Premier League next season,
                                        with the likes of Chelsea, Tottenham, Arsenal and even his former club
                                        reportedly weighing up moves for the playmaker.</p> <span>Richard Morgan</span>

                                    <p>The name James Rodriguez epitomises a long-running transfer saga. For five years
                                        and counting, his future at Real Madrid has been up for much debate, coming in
                                        and out of the transfer headlines when he has been linked with a handful of
                                        Premier League clubs, with a two-year loan at Bayern Munich wedged in.

                                        Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham, and even Everton,
                                        Newcastle and Wolves: they have all been linked with the Colombian at some point
                                        over the past half a decade as James found himself on the periphery of Zinedine
                                        Zidane's plans. With his contract up next summer, now might be the time for a
                                        permanent move and for James to feel loved by his employers. At Real, he simply
                                        has not been.

                                        At 28, he still has plenty to offer - he scored 15 and made 20 assists in 67
                                        games at Bayern - but his wages will be a problem for many, reported to be
                                        around £160,000-a-week. Even if James leaves for a cut-price deal, let's say
                                        £20m, he represents a risk for many Premier League sides. It will be intriguing
                                        to see where he finally goes, and whether a change of scenery can prompt him to
                                        recreate the form that saw him one of the world's most-wanted players at the
                                        2014 World Cup.</p>

                                    <h3>Kalidou Koulibaly: Finally on his way to the Premier League?</h3>
                                    <img src="https://e0.365dm.com/20/05/660x350/skysports-kalidou-koulibaly_5002692.jpg"
                                        alt="">
                                    <p>False peaks have long been found on the path to signing Napoli's man-mountain
                                        Kalidou Koulibaly, dubbed 'K2', but the stubborn Italian club are set to make
                                        the world's most sought-after defender available if they finalise a big-money
                                        deal for Lille forward Victor Osimhen.

                                        Liverpool's strict transfer policy prohibits them spending more than £60m on a
                                        29-year-old. But Manchester City, equipped financially and untethered from a
                                        Champions League ban, could ditch their usual age-profile and begin an ascent.

                                        Nathan Ake would be cheaper, but the authority, speed and experience of Senegal
                                        captain Koulibaly makes him an ideal partner to Aymeric Laporte, and Pep
                                        Guardiola's long-awaited replacement for Vincent Kompany.</p>

                                    <h3>Allan Saint-Maximin: Will Newcastle hold onto prize asset?</h3>
                                    <img src="https://e0.365dm.com/20/02/660x350/skysports-newcastle-oxford_4911685.jpg"
                                        alt="">
                                    <p>Transfer plans at St James' Park remain in torturous limbo as takeover silence
                                        continues to exhaust and deflate but, whatever the eventual outcome, Newcastle
                                        fans will be desperate to see Allan Saint-Maximin dancing through defences in
                                        the black and white again next term.

                                        Tyneside has a new great entertainer - only Adama Traore and Wilfried Zaha
                                        completed more dribbles in the Premier League season - but more of those
                                        edge-of-seat slaloms are starting to yield end product: the Frenchman has added
                                        four assists to his three goals and has created more big chances than any other
                                        team-mate.

                                        Steve Bruce might have served him a string of fines for "earrings, headbands and
                                        all sorts" but he reckons the £17m arrival from Nice last summer is the "best
                                        pound for pound signing in the Premier League" and has warned suitors - PSG,
                                        Napoli and Arsenal have been linked with a move - that "there is no chance" of
                                        him leaving. Bullish talk, but this is Newcastle, where anything can happen.</p>

                                    <h3>Thiago Alcantara: In search of a new adventure</h3>
                                    <img src="https://e0.365dm.com/20/03/660x350/skysports-thiago-alcantara_4959069.jpg"
                                        alt="">
                                    <p>It appears as though Thiago Alcantara's time in Germany is at an end after Bayern
                                        Munich chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge told Bild: "Alcantara wants to leave. It
                                        looks like he may want to do something new at the end of his career."

                                        What that new adventure will be is still to be decided, but the Spain
                                        international will not be short of suitors after seven trophy-laden years at the
                                        Allianz Arena and a knocked-down transfer fee with his Bayern contract expiring
                                        next year.

                                        It was Man City boss Pep Guardiola who took the Barcelona youth product with him
                                        when swapping Catalonia for Bavaria in 2013, shortly after his hat-trick saw
                                        Spain crowned European U21 champions, so do not rule out the pair being reunited
                                        at the Etihad next season.

                                        Meanwhile, Liverpool are also reportedly interested in signing the 29-year-old -
                                        whose father is Brazil World Cup winner Mazinho - in order to add some flair to
                                        the champions' workmanlike midfield.</p>

                                    <h3>Thomas Partey: Finances could see Atletico ace depart</h3>
                                    <img src="https://e2.365dm.com/20/05/660x350/skysports-thomas-partey-atletico-madrid_4984517.jpg"
                                        alt="">
                                    <p>Arsenal are reportedly ramping up their summer pursuit of Atletico Madrid's
                                        Thomas Partey, and it is clear to see why he is a player in such high demand.
                                        Partey's intentions and his reachable £45m-buyout clause make him one of
                                        Europe's most sought-after players.

                                        Atletico are willing to offer Partey double his current £65,000-a-week wages and
                                        are keen to insert a new £91m-buyout clause in his contract to fend off interest
                                        from elsewhere. But Arsenal are not the only European club to have been linked
                                        with the player plucked from Ghanaian club Odometah FC in 2012. Juventus and
                                        Manchester United are also said to be paying close attention to developments.

                                        Atletico accrued £178m in debt with Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim's company
                                        Inbursa in order to facilitate their move to the Wanda Metropolitano - and that
                                        is not due to be paid off in full until 2028. Diego Simeone is the world's
                                        highest-paid manager, and while he has taken a 70 per cent pay cut from his
                                        £36.2m salary, Atletico will be feeling the financial strain of the pandemic
                                        more than most clubs - less than a year after Joao Felix's arrival for a
                                        club-record £113m from Benfica.

                                        The emergence of Marcos Llorente as Partey's potential successor in the Atletico
                                        midfield looks like softening the blow of any sale this summer.</p>
